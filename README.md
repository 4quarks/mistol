## Usage Guide

1. Launch a fresh shell environment that does **not load history or profiles**, avoiding in-memory command traces:

   ```bash
   bash --norc --noprofile
   ```

3. Avoid using remote downloads (to prevent network logging). Instead, paste the script manually:

   ```bash
   vi mistol.sh
   ```

4. Execute MISTOL in dry-run mode (optional)

   ```bash
   chmod +x mistol.sh
   ./mistol.sh --dry-run
   ```

5. Close the temporary shell to discard in-memory history:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```
